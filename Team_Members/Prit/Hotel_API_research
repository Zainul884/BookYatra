I spent about 5 hours looking into APIs for our project and found that the Booking.com API by DataCrawler on RapidAPI is the best fit.
It lets us list hotels, search by location, get hotel details, check out the best prices, and more. 
It's more comprehensive than others like TripAdvisor and Sky Scrapper.
Here's the link to it: Booking.com API on RapidAPI: https://rapidapi.com/DataCrawler/api/booking-com15/
