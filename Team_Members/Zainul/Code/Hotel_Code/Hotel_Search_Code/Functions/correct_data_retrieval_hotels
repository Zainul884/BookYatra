//This piece of code is crucial to correctly display the hotels from the API to our website
//ChatGPT was used to fix some bugs in this code
//The prompt I entered was "This is my code for fetching hotels from the Booking.com API on RapidAPI. The hotels are not being fetched correctly so fix that.
//When I entered this, ChatGPT found my bug which was related to incorrect data handling of the information. The way I was handling the data and the way the API was handling the data was different.
